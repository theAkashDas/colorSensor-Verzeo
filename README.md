# colorSensor-Verzeo
To indentify RGB colors
Materials required:-RGB LED,LDR,bread board, Arduino UNO,Resistors,Jumper Wires
We see colors as a frequency of light reflected from an object.So different colors reflect different wavelength.A LDR reads the change in intensities and send signals to the serial monitor as outputs.
Color absorbs certain wavelength and reflects certain wavelength which we can use to detect the color.
Now using this intensities and some color intensity conditions we can sense the color of an object.
After sensing the color we will glow the detected color in a RGB led thereby completing our color sensing and showing work !!
